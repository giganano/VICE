""" 
In this file we demonstrate how to change VICE's nucleosynthetic yield 
settings. 

This file also serves as a demonstration of how these settings can be 
declared in a .py file and subsequently imported - run "import yields" in 
this directory and your nucleosynthetic yield settings will reflect this file.
