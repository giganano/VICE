- ``vice.yields.agb.ventura13``
	New set of theoretically predicted asymptotic giant branch star yields
	compiled from the following set of papers:

	- Ventura et al. (2013), MNRAS, 431, 3642 (Z = 0.0003, 0.008)
	- Ventura et al. (2014), MNRAS, 437, 3274 (Z = 0.004)
	- Ventura et al. (2018), MNRAS, 475, 2282 (Z = 0.014)
	- Ventura et al. (2020), A&A, 641, A103 (Z = 0.04)

	These tables also include unpublished yields from the same author at
	progenitor metallicities of Z = 0.001 and 0.002.

- ``vice.yields.agb.karakas16``

	compiled from Karakas & Lugaro (2016), ApJ, 825, 26 and Karakas et al.
	(2018), MNRAS, 477, 421. The Karakas & Lugaro (2016) tables provide yields
	for progenitor metallicities of Z = 0.007, 0.014, and 0.03, while the
	Karakas et al. (2018) tables provide them for Z = 0.0028, a metallicity

	arxiv:2103.14050. These studies report yields for double detonations of
	sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs at various progenitor metallicities.
	The Gronow et al. (2021a) study reports yields for white dwarf progenitors
	of solar metallicity, while Gronow et al. (2021b) report them for

	findings of Pitrou et al. (2021), MNRAS, 502, 2474.

- Command-Line Functionality
	When running ``vice --tutorial`` from the command line (or equivalently,
	``python -m vice --tutorial``), VICE first attempts to download the
	examples/QuickStartTutorial.ipynb jupyter notebook to the install directory,
	and then launches it locally. If it cannot download the notebook, it will
	launch a previously downloaded version if it has one. In the event that no
	local copy exists and it cannot be downloaded, it will raise a
	``RuntimeError``.
