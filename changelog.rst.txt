		the sun.

		yield via ``vice.yields.agb.settings`` is equivalent to going through

	Keyword argument ``"agb_model"`` **deprecated**, instead adopts the global 
	asymptotic giant branch star yield.

	similar to their supernova yields, rather than specifying keyword arguments 
	to functions and objects. 
	Entries can be a function of progenitor stellar mass and metallicity, in 
	that order, or a keyword denoting a built-in table of yields as in previous 
	versions. 

- ``vice.yields.agb.interpolator`` : ``object`` 
	New in this version. 
	Conducts bi-linear interpolation of the asymptotic giant branch star

	Keyword ``"IMF"`` can now be a user-defined function of stellar mass. 
	New keyword arguments: ``"explodability"``, ``"wind"``, ``"net"``: 

		- ``"explodability"`` : The fraction of stars which produce a core 
		  collapse supernova event as a function of progenitor zero age main 
		  sequence mass. 
		- ``"wind"`` : Whether or not to include stellar winds in the yield 
		  calculation.

- ``vice.yields.ccsne.engines`` : ``module`` 
	New in this version.

	the ``vice.yields.ccsne.fractional`` function.
