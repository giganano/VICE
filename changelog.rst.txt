1.1.0 
=====

New 
---
- Updated source code for Johnson & Weinberg (2020) figures following peer 
  review. 
- New chemical element: helium (``he``) 
- ``vice.primordial`` : ``dataframe`` 
	Mapping from elements to their abundance by mass immediately following 
	big bang nucleosynthesis. 
- ``vice.stable_isotopes`` : ``dataframe`` 
	Mapping from elements to their non-radioactive isotopes. 
- Nonzero post-main-sequence lifetimes. 
	* ``vice.cumulative_return_fraction`` 
	* ``vice.single_stellar_population`` 
	* ``vice.singlezone.postMS`` 
- ``vice.dataframe.remove`` : ``function`` 
	Remove a variable from a dataframe. 
- ``vice.dataframe.filter`` : ``function`` 
	Remove variables from a dataframe based on some criteria. 
- ``vice.yields.presets`` : ``module`` 
	Saved presets for nucleosynthetic yield settings. 

	* User-constructed presets 
	* ``vice.yields.presets.JW20``: built-in preset for Johnson & Weinberg 
	  (2020) adopted nucleosynthetic yields. 
- ``vice.elements`` : ``module`` 
	A means of accessing yields and other data on an element-by-element basis. 
- ``vice.imf`` : ``module`` 
	Functional forms for popular stellar initial mass functions. 
- ``vice.singlezone.verbose`` : ``property`` 
	Singlezone object can be set to print the simulation time as it runs. 
- ``vice.singlezone.from_output`` : ``function`` 
	Obtain a singlezone object with the same parameters as the one which 
	produced some output. Replaces ``vice.mirror`` (now deprecated). 
- ``vice.output.zip`` and ``vice.output.unzip`` : ``function`` 
	Zip and unzip VICE simulation output directories. 
- ``vice.VisibleRuntimeWarning`` : ``Warning`` 
	A ``RuntimeWarning`` which - contrary to the built-in version - is visible 
	by default. 
- ``vice.VisibleDeprecationWarning`` : ``Warning`` 
	A ``DeprecationWarning`` which - contrary to the built-in version - is 
	visible by default. 

Patches 
-------
- Fixed a bug that didn't allow metal enhanced outflows in the ``singlezone`` 
  object.
