Nucleosynthetic Yield Presets 

.. versionadded:: 1.1.0 

Save copies of user-constructed yield settings for loading into VICE. Users 
can create external yield scripts which modify VICE's nucleosynthetic yield 
settings, then make these settings available to import statements. 

.. note:: These features may not function properly if VICE is installed 
	locally (i.e. if it was installed with a ``--user`` flag). Please speak 
	with your administrator about installing VICE globally if this is an 
	issue. 

Contents
