	Calculate an IMF-integrated fractional net nucleosynthetic yield of a 
	given element from core-collapse supernovae. 

	**Signature**: vice.yields.ccsne.fractional(element, study = "LC18", 
	MoverH = 0, rotation = 0, explodability = None, IMF = "kroupa",

	Nmin = 64, Nmax = 2.0e+08) 

	Parameters 
	----------
	element : ``str`` [case-insensitive] 
		The symbol of the element to calculate the IMF-integrated fractional 
		yield for. 
	study : ``str`` [case-insensitive] [default : "LC18"] 
		A keyword denoting which study to adopt the yields from 

		Keywords and their Associated Studies: 

			- "LC18": Limongi & Chieffi (2018) [1]_ 
			- "CL13": Chieffi & Limongi (2013) [2]_ 
			- "NKT13": Nomoto, Kobayashi & Tominaga (2013) [3]_ 
			- "CL04": Chieffi & Limongi (2004) [4]_ 
			- "WW95": Woosley & Weaver (1995) [5]_ 

	MoverH : real number [default : 0] 
		The total metallicity [M/H] of the exploding stars. There are only a 
		handful of metallicities recognized by each study. 

		Keywords and their Associated Metallicities: 

			- "LC18": [M/H] = -3, -2, -1, 0 
			- "CL13": [M/H] = 0 
			- "NKT13": [M/H] = -inf, -1.15, -0.54, -0.24, 0.15, 0.55 
			- "CL04": [M/H] = -inf, -4, -2, -1, -0.37, 0.15 
			- "WW95": [M/H] = -inf, -4, -2, -1, 0 

	rotation : real number [default : 0] 
		The rotational velocity of the exploding stars in km/s. There are only 
		a handful of rotational velocities recognized by each study. 

		Keywords and their Associated Rotational Velocities: 

			- "LC18": v = 0, 150, 300 
			- "CL13": v = 0, 300 
			- "NKT13": v = 0 
			- "CL04": v = 0 
			- "WW95": v = 0 

	IMF : ``str`` [case-insensitive] or <function> [default : "kroupa"] 
		The stellar initial mass function (IMF) to assume. Strings denote 
		built-in IMFs, which must be either "Kroupa" [6]_ or "Salpeter" [7]_. 
		Functions must accept stellar mass in :math:`M_\odot` as the only 
		numerical paraneter and will be interpreted as a custom, arbitrary 
		stellar IMF. 
	method : ``str`` [case-insensitive] [default : "simpson"] 
		The method of quadrature. 

		Recognized Methods: 

			- "simpson" 
			- "trapezoid" 
			- "midpoint" 
			- "euler" 

		.. note:: These methods of quadrature are implemented according to 
			Chapter 4 of Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling & Flannery (2007) [8]_. 

	m_lower : real number [default : 0.08] 
		The lower mass limit on star formation in :math:`M_\odot`. 
	m_upper : real number [default : 100] 
		The upper mass limit on star formation in :math:`M_\odot`. 
	tolerance : real number [default : 0.001] 
		The numerical tolerance. VICE will not return a result until the 
		fractional change between two successive integrations is smaller than 
		this value. 
	Nmin : real number [default : 64] 
		The minimum number of bins in quadrature. 
	Nmax : real number [default : 2.0e+08] 
		The maximum number of bins in quadrature. Included as a failsafe 
		against solutions that din't converge numerically. 

	Returns 
	-------
	y : real number 
		The numerically calculated yield. 
	error : real number 
		The estimated numerical error. 

	Raises 
	------
	* ValueError 
		- 	The element is not built into VICE 
		- 	The study is not built into VICE 
		- 	The tolerance is not between 0 and 1 
		- 	m_lower > m_upper 
		- 	Custom IMF does not accept exactly 1 positional argument 
		- 	Built-in IMF is not recognized 
		- 	The method of quadrature is not built into VICE 
		- 	Nmin > Nmax 
	* LookupError 
		- 	The study did not report yields at the specified metallicity 
		- 	The study did not report yields at the specified rotational 
			velocity. 
	* ScienceWarning 
		- 	m_upper is larger than the largest mass on the grid reported by the 
			specified study. VICE extrapolates to high masses in this case. 
		- 	study is either "CL04" or "CL13" and the atomic number of the 
			element is between 24 and 28 (inclusive). VICE warns against 
			adopting these yields for iron peak elements. 
		- 	Numerical quadrature did not converge within the maximum number 
			of allowed quadrature bins to within the specified tolerance. 

	Notes 
	-----
	This function evaluates the solution to the following equation. 

	.. math:: y_x^\text{CC} \frac{
		\int_8^u m_x \frac{dN}{dm} dm 
		}{
		\int_l^u m_x \frac{dN}{dm} dm 
		}

	.. note:: The nucleosynthetic yield tables built into VICE do not include 
		any treatment of radioactive isotopes. The above equation is evaluated 
		directly from the total mass yield of stable isotopes only. In this 
		regard, if any element has a significant contribution to its 
		nucleosynthesis from radioactive decay products, then the values 
		returned from this function should be interpreted as lower bounds 
		rather than estimates of the true nucleosynthetic yield.

	Science Warnings 
	================
	1) The Limongi & Chieffi (2018) and Chieffi & Limongi (2013) studies 
	reported yields up to 120 Msun, so warn the user that for upper mass 
	limits higher than this that their yields will be extrapolated. The same 
	is true for the Chieffi & Limongi (2004) yields with upper mass limits 
	of 35 Msun and the Woosley & Weaver (1995) study with upper mass limits 
	of 40 Msun. 

	2) The Chieffi & Limongi (2004) and the Chieffi & Limongi (2013) studies 
	involved numerical simulations of core collapse explosions with dialed-in 
	explosion energy. In their models, the mass of nickel-56 produced was 
	fixed. As such, one should exercise caution when employing their yields of 
	iron-peak elements. 

	3) The Woosley & Weaver (1995) study reported yields up to 40 Msun. Warn 
	the user about extrapolation to higher initial masses. 

	4) If the user specifies explodability in combination with either the 
	Limongi & Chieffi (2018) or Sukhbold et al. (2016) yields, the 
	explodability is over-specified. The yields reported by these studies are
