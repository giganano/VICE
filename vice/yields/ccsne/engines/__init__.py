Core collapse supernova explosion engines: explodability as a function of
progenitor mass in solar masses.

**Signature**: from vice.yields.ccsne import engines

.. versionadded:: 1.2.0

.. tip:: Instances of the ``engine`` class can be passed as the keyword
	argument ``explodability`` to ``vice.yields.ccsne.fractional`` to calculate
	IMF-averaged yields assuming a particular black hole landscape. The impact
	of these assumptions is explored in Griffith et al. (2021) [1]_.

Contents
--------
engine : ``type``
	The base class implemented in this module.
cutoff : ``engine``
	An engine characterized by a threshold mass, below which stars explode as
	CCSNe, and above which stars collapse directly to a black hole.
E16 : ``engine``
	An engine implementing the Ertl et al. (2016) [2]_ model, characterized
	by the two parameters :math:`M_4` and :math:`\mu_4`.
S16 : ``module``
	Explodability maps as reported by the various models in Sukhbold et al.
	(2016) [3]_.
