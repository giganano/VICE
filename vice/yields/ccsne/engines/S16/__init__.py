Core collapse supernova explosion engines: explodability as a function of
progenitor mass in solar masses as reported by the Sukhbold et al. (2016) [1]_
models.

**Signature**: from vice.yields.ccsne.engines import S16

.. versionadded:: 1.2.0

.. tip:: Instances of the ``engine`` class can be passed the keyword argument
	``explodability`` to ``vice.yields.ccsne.fractional`` to calculate
	IMF-averaged yields assuming a particular black hole landscape. The impact
	of these assumptions is explored in Griffith et al. (2021) [2]_.

.. note:: For all explosion engines, progenitors with zero age main sequence
	masses between 9 and 12 :math:`M_\odot` proceed according to the Z9.6
	engine, while remaining masses explode or collapse according to the
	associated engine. (See: Section 2.2.2 of Sukhbold et al. 2016)
