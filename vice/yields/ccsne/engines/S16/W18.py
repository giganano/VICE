	W18 core collapse supernova explosion engine as reported by Sukhbold et al.

	.. versionadded:: 1.2.0 

	.. tip:: This object can be passed as the keyword argument ``explodability`` 
		to ``vice.yields.ccsne.fractional`` to calculate IMF-averaged yields 
		assuming this black hole landscape. 

	This object inherits its functionality from the base class 
	``vice.yields.ccsne.engines.engine`` with the attribute ``frequencies`` 
	assigned according to the W18 explosion engine. See the associated 
	documentation for further details.
