""" 
VICE Pickle Utility Functions 
=============================

.. warning:: User access of these routines is discouraged. 

Handles pickling of ``singlezone`` and ``multizone`` object attributes. These 
objects themselves are not pickles, because there is always at least one 
functional attribute. Encoding functional attributes requires dill_, a 
*secondary* dependence of VICE which is an extension to ``pickle`` in the 
python standard library. It is recommended that VICE user's install dill_ >= 
0.2.0.

	name : ``str`` [default : "objects"] 
		The attribute ``name``, initialized via keyword argument.
