def mdf(name): 
	r""" 
	Obtain a ``fromfile`` object from a VICE output containing the metallicity 
	distribution function of stars. 

	**Signature**: vice.mdf(name) 

	Parameters 
	----------
	name : ``str`` 
		The full or relative path to the output directory. The '.vice' 
		extension is not required. 

	Returns 
	-------
	mdf : ``fromfile`` [VICE ``dataframe`` derived class] 
		A subclass of the VICE dataframe designed to handle simulation output. 

	Raises 
	------
	* IOError [Only occurs if the output has been altered] 
		- The output file is not found. 
		- The output file is not formatted correctly. 
		- Other VICE output files are missing from the output. 

	Notes 
	-----
	VICE normalizes metallicity distribution functions to a probability 
	density, meaning that the area under the distribution is always equal to 
	one. The value of the distribution in some bin times that bin's width 
	denotes the fraction of stars with metallicities in that bin. 

	.. note:: For abundances [X/H] and abundance ratios [X/Y] that in the 
		simulation never achieve a value in the user-specified binspace, the 
		distribution will be ``NaN`` in all bins. 

	.. note:: For an output under a given name, the metallicity distribution 
		function is stored in an ascii text file under name.vice/mdf.out. This 
		allows users to open these files without VICE if necessary. 

	.. seealso:: vice.core.dataframe.fromfile 

	Example Code 
	------------
	>>> import vice 
	>>> example = vice.mdf("example") 
	>>> example.keys() 
		[“dn/d[sr/h],”,
		“dn/d[sr/fe],” 
		“bin_edge_left,” 
		“dn/d[o/h],” 
		“dn/d[o/fe],” 
		“dn/d[fe/h],” 
		“bin_edge_right,” 
		“dn/d[o/sr]”] 
	>>> example["bin_edge_left"][:10] 
		[-3.0, -2.95, -2.9, -2.85, -2.8, -2.75, -2.7, -2.65, -2.6, -2.55] 
	>>> example[60] 
		vice.dataframe{
			bin_edge_left --> 0.0
			bin_edge_right -> 0.05
			dn/d[fe/h] -----> 0.0
			dn/d[sr/h] -----> 0.0
			dn/d[o/h] ------> 0.0
			dn/d[sr/fe] ----> 0.06001488
			dn/d[o/fe] -----> 0.4337209
