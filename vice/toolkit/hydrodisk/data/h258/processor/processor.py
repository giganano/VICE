	-----
	This function simply ensures that all cuts are passed via the python

	Returns
	-------
	test : bool
		True if the star particle was born <= 150 Myr before the first
		snapshot in which it appeared. False otherwise.

	Notes

	This is a quality cut to ensure that the birth radius of a given star

		False otherwise.

	Notes
	-----
	Star particles born prior to 0.5 Gyr into the h258 are not included in the

		The fits file object opened by calling astropy.io.fits with the input

	Returns
	-------
	test : bool
		True if the star particle passes the spatial cut. False otherwise.
