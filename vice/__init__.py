VICE: Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution 

Provides
--------
- A dataframe object meant for case-insensitive lookup 
- Simulations of galactic chemical evolution models 
- Simulations of nucleosynthesis from single stellar populations 
- Built-in yield tables from nucleosynthesis studies 

How to Access the Documentation: 
--------------------------------
Documentation is available in several forms: 

	1. Docstrings embedded within the code 
	2. On PyPI 
	3. In PDF format 
	4. Tutorials and example scripts, available in the git repository 

Run ``vice-docs`` from the command line to open the documentation in the 
default web browser. 

Contents 
--------
singlezone : ``type`` 
	Simulate a single-zone galactic chemical evolution model 
output : ``type`` 
	Read and store output from single- and multi-zone simulations. 
single_stellar_population : <function> 
	Simulate enrichment from a single conatal star cluster 
cumulative_return_fraction : <function> 
	Calculate the cumulative return fraction of a star cluster of known age 
main_sequence_mass_fraction : <function> 
	Calculate the main sequence mass fraction of a star cluster of known age 
imf : <module> 
	Built-in funcitonal forms of popular stellar initial mass functions. 
yields : <module> 
	Calculate, access, and declare nucleosynthetic yield settings for use in 
	simulations. 
elements : <module> 
	Access, and declare nucleosynthetic yield settings for use in simulations. 
	Access other relevant information for each element such as the solar 
	abundance or atomic number. 
dataframe : ``type`` 
	An extension to the Python type ``dict`` to allow case-insensitivity. 
history : <function> 
	Reads in time-evolution of interstellar medium from singlezone simulation. 
mdf : <function> 
	Reads in stellar metallicity distribution from singlezone simulation. 

Built-In Dataframes 
-------------------
- atomic_number : The atomic number of each element 
- primordial : The abundance of each element following big bang nucleosynthesis. 
- solar_z : The abundance of each element in the sun. 
- sources : The primary astrophysical production channels of each element. 
- stable_isotopes : Lists of each elements' stable isotopes. 

Utilities
---------
- VisibleDeprecationWarning : A DeprecationWarning that is visible by default. 
- VisibleRuntimeWarning : A RuntimeWarning that is visible by default. 
- ScienceWarning : A Warning concerning scientific accuracy and precision. 
- test : Runs VICE's unit tests. 
- version : VICE's version breakdown. 
- __version__ : The version string.
