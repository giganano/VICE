/*
 * This file handles logging within VICE for development and debugging
 * purposes. VICE subscribes to a conventional format, where there are six
 * different types of verbosity for logging:
 * 
 * 1. info: General information regarding the process executed by the program.
 * 2. trace: Individual function calls and the files in which they're
 *    implemented.
 * 3. debug: Print the names of functions being called, the files in which
 *    they're implemented, the line numbers calling the logging print statement,
 *    and variable states.
 * 4. warning: Prints regardless of the user's logging level and whether or not
 *    they've ignored warnings in Python. Does not stop the program.
 * 5. error: A state is reached in which VICE cannot continue the calculation.
 *    This exits the python interpreter always.
 * 6. fatal: A state is reached in which VICE cannot *safely* continue the
 *    calculation. This exits the python interpreter always.
