Getting Started 
===============
VICE's core developers are happy to consult with scientists looking to 
incorporate it into their research. Any questions users may have can be 
emailed to the primary author (James W. Johnson: giganano9@gmail.com). 


Tutorial 
--------
Under ``examples`` in VICE's `GitHub repository`__ is the `tutorial`__, 
a ``jupyter notebook`` intended to provide first-time users with a primer on 
how to use all of VICE's features. After installation, this jupyter notebook 
can be viewed in the web browser by running ``vice --tutorial`` from the 
command line. Alternatively, if installing from source, it can be launched via 
``make tutorial`` in the root directory. To download this jupyter notebook, 
simply clone the git repository if you haven't already, and it will be under 
the ``examples`` directory.

Example Code
------------
We provide `example scripts`__ in VICE's GitHub repository under ``examples``, 
alongside the `tutorial`__.

Accessing Documentation 
-----------------------
After installing VICE, the documentation can be launched in a browser window 
via the ``vice --docs`` command line entry. If this feature does not work 
after installing VICE, troubleshooting can be found `here`__. Documentation 
can also be found in the docstrings embedded in the code, and in the 
`GitHub repository`__.

From the Command Line 
---------------------
VICE allows simple one-zone models to be ran directly from the command line. 
For instructions on how to use this functionality, run ``vice --help`` in a 
terminal from any directory (with the exception of VICE's source directory). 
If the ``vice`` command-line entry isn't working, it's possible the variant 
``python3 -m vice`` is required. Further troubleshooting can be found `here`__. 

**Note**: VICE's functionality is severely limited when ran from the command 
line in comparison to its full python_ capabilities.
