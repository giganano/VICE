Core Collapse Supernovae 
------------------------
Because core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are assumed to occur simultaneously 
with the formation of their progenitor stars [2]_, :math:`y_x^\text{CC}` 
represents the total yield from all CCSNe associated with a single stellar 
population. Letting :math:`m_x` denote the net mass of some element :math:`x` 
present in the CCSN ejecta, the yield at a given metallicity is defined by: 

.. math:: y_x^\text{CC} \equiv \frac{
	\int_{l_\text{CC}}^u (E(m)m_x + w_x - Z_{x,\text{prog}} m) 
	\frac{dN}{dm} dm 
	}{
	\int_l^u m \frac{dN}{dm} dm 
	}

where the numerator is taken from the minimum mass for a CCSN explosion 
:math:`l_\text{CC}` to the upper mass limit of star formation :math:`u`, but 
the denominator is over the entire mass range of star formation, and 
:math:`dN/dm` is the stellar initial mass function (IMF). This equation is 
nothing more or less than the mathematical statement of "production divided 
by total initial mass." 
:math:`E(m)` denotes the *explodability*: the fraction of star of mass 
:math:`m` which explode as a CCSN. :math:`w_x` denotes the mass yield of the 
element :math:`x` due to winds at a mass :math:`m`, and the corrective term 
:math:`Z_{x,\text{prog}} m` accounts for the birth abundances of the star to 
compute a *net* rather than a *gross* yield. The constant 
``CC_MIN_STELLAR_MASS`` declares :math:`l_\text{CC} = 8 M_\odot` in 
``vice/src/ccsne.h``. 

In practice, supernova nucleosynthesis studies determine the value of 
:math:`m_x` for of order 10 values of :math:`m` at a given metallicity and 
rotational velocity. To compute the numerator of this equation, VICE adopts a 
grid of :math:`m_x` and :math:`w_x` values from a user-specified 
nucleosynthesis study, interpolating linearly between values of :math:`m` on 
the grid. We clarify that the interpolation is linear in :math:`m`, and not 
:math:`\log m`. 

In this version of VICE, users can choose between the following 
nucleosynthesis studies: 

	- Limongi & Chieffi (2018), ApJS, 237, 13 
	- Sukhbold et al. (2016), ApJ, 821, 38 (W18 and N20 explosion engines) 
	- Chieffi & Limongi (2013), ApJ, 764, 21 
	- Nomoto, Kobayashi & Tominaga (2013), ARA&A, 51, 547 
	- Chieffi & Limongi (2004), ApJ, 608, 405 
	- Woosley & Weaver (1995), ApJS, 101, 181 

VICE affords users the ability to specify whether or not winds should be 
included in their yield calculations; it stores values of :math:`w_x` for all 
recognized elements at each metallicity and rotational velocity it has 
built-in tables for. It also allows users the option to calculate net or 
gross yields based on whether or not it sets :math:`Z_{x,\text{prog}}` equal 
to zero. We caution however that not every study separates their wind yields 
from their explosive yields, in which case :math:`w_x = 0` and the wind 
contribution is included in :math:`m_x`. Furthermore, not every study reports 
the detailed initial composition of their model stars, in which case 
assigning :math:`Z_{x,\text{prog}}` is ambiguous. For these studies VICE is 
incapable of computing net yields, so it sets :math:`Z_{x,\text{prog}}` to 
zero always for these studies, only reporting gross yields. For a breakdown on 
which of these cautionary tales apply to which studies, we refer users to the 
``vice.yields.ccsne.fractional`` documentation. 

By default, VICE will assume that all stars above :math:`8 M_\odot` explode 
as a CCSN. Because stellar explodability is an open question in astronomy [3]_, 
:math:`E(m)` can be specified as an arbitrary mathematical function, which 
must accept stellar mass in :math:`M_\odot` as the only parameter. Lastly, 
this can be done with either the built-in Kroupa [4]_ or Salpeter [5]_ IMFs, 
or a function of mass interpreted as a user-constructed IMF. 

.. note:: VICE also forces :math:`m_x` = 0 at :math:`8 M_\odot`, the default 
	value of :math:`l_\text{CC}`, in order to minimize numerical artifacts 
	introduced when extrapolating off of the grid in :math:`m` to lower 
	stellar masses. 

Although :math:`E(m)` can take on any mathematical form in VICE as long as its 
value is always between 0 and 1, a number of popular forms both simple and 
complex can be found in the ``vice.yields.ccsne.engines`` module. 

Users can evaluate the solution to this equation by calling the function 
``vice.yields.ccsne.fractional``, implemented in 
``vice/yields/ccsne/_yield_integrator.pyx``. This function makes use of 
numerical quadrature routines written in ANSI/ISO C built into VICE, and is 
thus not dependent on any publicly available quadrature functions such as 
those found in ``scipy``. 

In addition to evaluating the solution to this equation, users may also 
read in the table of :math:`m_x` values by calling ``vice.yields.ccsne.table``, 
and may request the full isotopic breakdown. A ``dataframe`` is returned from 
this function. 

.. note:: These functions have no impact whatsoever on the chemical enrichment 
	simulations built into VICE. Users declare their own yields for that 
	purpose, while this function merely calculates them.
