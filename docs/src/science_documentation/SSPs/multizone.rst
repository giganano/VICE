In Multizone Models 
-------------------
Like the timesteps in singlezone simulations, VICE treats star particles in 
multizone simulations as stand-ins for entire stellar populations. They eject 
newly produced heavy nuclei to the interstellar medium and recycle mass at 
their birth metallicities at the rates detailed in this section, where 
:math:`M_\star` denotes the mass of the star particle.
