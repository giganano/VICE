Enrichment from Single Stellar Populations 
------------------------------------------
While galaxies form stars continuously, it is often an interesting scientific 
problem to quantify the nucleosynthetic production of only one population of 
conatal stars. This is inherently cheaper computationally, since this is only 
one stellar population while galaxy simulations require many stellar 
populations. 

VICE includes functionality for simulating the mass production of a given 
element from a single stellar population (i.e. an individual star cluster) of 
given mass and metallicity under user-specified yields. This by construction 
does not take into account depletion from infall low metallicity gas and star 
formation, ejection in outflows, recycling, etc. It only calculates the mass 
production of the element as a function of the stellar population's age. 

The star cluster is assumed to form at time :math:`t = 0`, and thus at this 
time there is no net production. Because VICE operates under the assumption 
that all core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) occur instantaneously following the 
star cluster's formation [11]_, the entire CCSN net yield is injected within 
the first timestep at :math:`t = \Delta t`: 

.. math:: \Delta M_x = y_x^\text{CC}(Z) M_\star 

where :math:`y_x^\text{CC}(Z)` is the user's current setting for CCSN yields 
at a stellar metallicity Z. At subsequent timesteps, enrichment from 
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is injected according to [12]_: 

.. math:: \dot{M}_x^\text{AGB}\Delta t \approx 
	y_x^\text{AGB}(m_\text{postMS}(t), Z)M_\star
	\left[h(t) - h(t + \Delta t)\right] 

and from type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) according to [13]_: 

.. math:: \dot{M}_x^\text{Ia}\Delta t \approx 
	y_x^\text{Ia}(Z) M_\star \frac{
	R_\text{Ia}(t) 
	}{
	\int_0^\infty R_\text{Ia}(t') dt' 
	} 

These are the same equations that are implemented in simulating enrichment 
under the single-zone approximation, but applied to only one episode of star 
formation. 

Users can run these simulations by calling ``vice.single_stellar_population``.
