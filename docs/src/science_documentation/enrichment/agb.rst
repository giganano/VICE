Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars 
-----------------------------
Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are evolved stars that have carbon-oxygen 
cores surrounded by helium and hydrogen shells. These stars undergo thermal 
pulsations due to explosive ignition of helium fusion in the shell, typically 
referred to as helium shell flashes. During these pulses, material from the 
core is often mixed into the outer layers via convection, a process known as 
*dredge-up*. This brings heavy nuclei produced in the deeper regions of the 
star to the envelope, which is then ejected to the interstellar medium (ISM). 
This is one of the primary sites of s-process nucleosynthesis in the universe.  

It may be tempting to model AGB star enrichment as a delay-time distribution 
(DTD) similar to that adopted for SNe Ia. However, this approach would 
implicitly adopt the assumption that every element is enriched via AGB stars 
with the same DTD, or that for a given element, the effective DTD is 
independent of metallicity. These may be fine assumptions, but it is not 
adopted in VICE due to the desire for as few assumptions as possible. 

Instead, AGB star enrichment in VICE is implemented using the 
:ref:`mass-lifetime relationship for stars <mlr>` and the 
:ref:`main sequence mass fraction <msmf>` (MSMF). However, the form of the 
:ref:`MSMF <msmf>` required here differs in detail from the true 
:ref:`MSMF <msmf>`. Being evolved stars, the 
:ref:`MSMF <msmf>` does not consider AGB stars. It is thus not the 
:ref:`MSMF <msmf>` and the main sequence lifetimes of stars that are of 
interest, but the mass fraction of both main sequence and evolved stars and 
the *total* lifetime of stars. The form of :math:`h(t)` necessary for modeling 
AGB star enrichment then changes to: 

.. math:: h(t) \rightarrow \frac{
	\int_l^{m_\text{postMS}(t)} m \frac{dN}{dm} dm 
	}{
	\int_l^u m \frac{dN}{dm} dm 
	}

The numerator is evaluated from :math:`l` to the mass of stars ending their 
post main sequence lifetime :math:`m_\text{postMS}` rather than the main 
sequence turnoff mass :math:`m_\text{to}`. As detailed 
:ref:`here <mlr_m_postMS>` for a stellar population of age :math:`\tau`: 

.. math:: m_\text{postMS} = \left(\frac{\tau}{(1 + p_\text{MS})\tau_\odot} 
	\right)^{-1/\alpha} 

where :math:`\alpha` is the power-law index on the 
:ref:`mass-lifetime relationship <mlr>`, :math:`\tau_\odot` is the main 
sequence lifetime of the sun, and :math:`p_\text{MS}` is the ratio of a star's 
post main sequence lifetime to its main sequence lifetime. 

From a single stellar population, the rate of ejection of an element :math:`x` 
from AGB stars to the ISM is given by: 

.. math:: \dot{M}_x^\text{AGB} = 
	-\epsilon_x^\text{AGB}y_x^\text{AGB}(m_\text{postMS}, Z)M_\star\dot{h} 

where :math:`\dot{h}` is evaluated at the lookback time to the stellar 
population's formation [3]_, :math:`M_\star` is the initial mass of the 
stellar population, and :math:`y_x^\text{AGB}` is the 
*fractional net yield* of :math:`x` from an AGB star of initial mass 
:math:`m_\text{postMS}` and metallicity :math:`Z`: the fraction of a single 
star's initial mass that is processed into element :math:`x` *and* ejected to 
the interstellar medium *minus* the amount that the star was born with. 
:math:`\epsilon_x^\text{AGB}` is the *entrainment fraction* of the element 
:math:`x` from AGB stars; this is the mass fraction of the net yield which is 
retained by the interstellar medium, the remainder of which is added directly 
to the outflow. 

.. note:: VICE implements recycling of previously produced elements separate 
	from nucleosynthetic yields, running from the standpoint of *net* rather 
	than *absolute* yields. 

For continuous star formation, the enrichment rate can be expressed as this 
quantity integrated over the star formation history: 

.. math:: \dot{M}_x^\text{AGB} = 
	-\int_0^t y_x^\text{AGB}(m_\text{postMS}(t - t'), Z_\text{ISM}(t')) 
	\dot{M}_\star(t') \dot{h}(t - t') dt 

This expression is approximated numerically as: 

.. math:: \dot{M}_x^\text{AGB} \approx 
	\sum_i y_x^\text{AGB}(m_\text{postMS}(t - i\Delta t), 
	Z_\text{ISM}(i\Delta t)) \dot{M}_\star(i\Delta t) 
	\left[h((i + 1)\Delta t) - h(i\Delta t)\right] 

where the summation is taken over all previous timesteps. 
The need to differentiate :math:`h` with time is eliminated in the 
numerical approximation by allowing each stellar population to be weighted 
by :math:`\Delta h` between the current timestep and the next, made possible 
by the quantization of timesteps. 

In practice, :math:`y_x^\text{AGB}` is highly uncertain [4]_. VICE therefore 
makes no assumptions about the user's desired form of the yield; this 
parameter can be assigned either a built-in table published in an AGB star 
nucleosynthesis study or a function of stellar mass and metallicity 
constructed by the user.

.. [3] There is a minus sign here because :math:`h(t)` is a monotonically 
	decreasing function, and thus :math:`\dot{h} < 0`.
