Implementation
==============

Motivation
----------
VICE is designed in such a manner that as few assumptions as possible are made 
by the software itself. In this manner, the power the user has over the 
parameters of their simulations is maximized. With this motivation, any 
quantities that may vary are allowed to do so under user-constructed functions 
in Python_. The only assumption VICE's model adopts is physical plausibility.

Numerical Approach 
------------------
Because VICE is built to handle singlezone simulations, numerics 
are not the dominant source of error, but rather in the model itself. The 
assumption of instantaneous diffusion of newly produced metals introduces an 
error that which is larger than even modest numerical errors to the equations 
presented in this documentation. 

For this reason, VICE is implemented with a Forward Euler timestep solution, 
and its errors are not dominated by numerics. Furthermore, quantization of the 
timesteps allows the quantization of the episodes of star formation with no 
further assumptions. At several instances in this documentation, this will 
simplify the equations considerably. Adopting a user-specified timestep size, 
this also makes it the computationally cheapest solution by not introducing 
intermediate timesteps. In this manner, VICE is able to achieve a high degree 
of generality while retaining powerful computing speeds. 

Minimization of Dependencies
----------------------------
VICE is implemented in its entirety in ANSI/ISO C, standard library Python_, 
and standard library Cython_. With this implementation, VICE is entirely 
cross platform and independent of the user's version of Anaconda_ (or 
lackthereof). However, VICE is not wrapped for installation in a Windows 
environment without modifying the installation source code. We recommend users 
install and run VICE in a linux environment using the `Windows Terminal`__.

Timed Runs 
----------
Due to the Forward Euler implementation and the requirement to calculate 
enrichment from previous episodes of star formation, we expect the integration 
time to scale with the square of the number of timesteps (i.e. 
:math:`T \propto (T_\text{end}/\Delta t)^2)`. VICE also treats each element 
independently and equally; the equations of enrichment are evaluated for 
an arbitrary element :math:`x`. The integration time should thus scale 
linearly with the number of elements :math:`N`. 

Because VICE was implemented with the scientific motivation of studying the 
enrichment of oxygen, iron, and strontium under starburst evolutionary 
scenarios (Johnson & Weinberg 2020 [1]_), the first integrations were ran 
with these three elements. With timesteps of :math:`\Delta t` = 1 Myr, each 
simulation finished in 20.4 seconds on a system with a processing speed of 
2.7 GHz. With these proportionalities and this calibration, we expect the 
following scaling relation to describe the time per integration of the 
``singlezone`` object as a function of the number of elements :math:`N`, the 
end time :math:`T_\text{end}`, and the timestep size :math:`\Delta t`: 

.. math:: T = \left(\frac{\text{Processor Speed}}{2.7\text{ GHz}}\right)^{-1} 
	\left(\frac{T_\text{end}/\Delta t}{10^4}\right)^2 
	N(6.8\text{ seconds}) 

Because 1 Myr is a relatively fine timestep, most integrations will typically 
not take this long. The default timestep size of 10 Myr is expected to finish 
in 68 milliseconds per element.

	Timed runs with :math:`N` = 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 elements with timesteps 
	ranging from 500 kyr to 10 Myr (solid lines) with an ending time of 
	:math:`T_\text{end}` = 10 Gyr. The color-coded dotted lines show the 
	:math:`N\Delta t^{-2}` expected scaling relation. The fit does well for 
	small :math:`\Delta t`, but underpredicts the integration time for coarse 
	timestepping; this is due to the transition from an algorithm limited 
	simulation to a write out limited simulation. The scaling relation also 
	slightly underpredicts the integration time for high N simulations. 

:ref:`Here <fig_timer>` we plot the integration time for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 
25 elements with timesteps ranging from 500 kyr to 10 Myr in comparison to the 
expected scaling relation. For small :math:`\Delta t`, the scaling relation 
describes the integration time with sufficient accuracy, although slightly 
underpredicts the integration time when the number of elements is large. This 
also underpredicts the integration time for coarse timestepping; this is 
because this scaling relation does not take into account write-out time. For 
large :math:`\Delta t`, the ``singlezone`` object is not algorithm limited 
but write-out limited. Write out time may also be a potential reason that 
the integration time is mildly underpredicted for small :math:`\Delta t` and 
high :math:`N`.
