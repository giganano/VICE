From the Command Line 
=====================
Included with VICE is a command line entry which runs simple simulations from 
a terminal. This feature allows the parameters of a onezone model to be 
specified as command-line arguments; run ``vice --help`` from a terminal 
after installing VICE (from any directory except the source tree). While these 
command-line capabilities are useful for their ease, VICE is severaly limited 
in capability when ran from the command-line in comparison to when ran from 
the Python_ interpreter. 

VICE also includes a command-line entry for automatically accessing the 
documentation. Simply run ``vice-docs`` from any directory except the source 
tree, and the documentation will be opened by the default web browser.
